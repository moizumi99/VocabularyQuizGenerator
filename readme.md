This is a script that generates a quiz from English words highlighted in any Kindle book.
To run this, you need
- Python 3.x
- html export of highlights from Kindle for PC
- Text file output from Eijiro (English - Japanese Dictionary)
Plus, the quiz runs on P-Study System

The details of the operation is described in my blog post.

The blog is written in Japanese because this script and the generated quiz are only useful for Japanese speakers.
